# Portfolio2.0
Welcome to my portfolio!  i decided to start this sideproject during the coding bootcamp I attended (UCF coding Bootcapm). After learning more technologies i desire to re-design my portfolio to make look more like me. The first portfolio was a simple static HTML page that required a serious upgrade.
## Future Development
As for the back-end, all projects will be stored in a MySQL database, and an admin portal would be added, allowing projects to be added/edited.
